## What this is

Personal portfolio for **Zephaniah Raika**, a creative photographer and amateur videographer who also does design and fitness. It's a single-page site with a dark background, bright accent colors, big display type, and heavy motion. The visual reference is https://spector.framer.website/.

## Tech stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, `app/` directory, Turbopack, `cacheComponents` on)
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4. Theme tokens live in `@theme` in `app/globals.css`, and there is no `tailwind.config`.
- **Animation:** [Motion](https://motion.dev) (`motion/react`) for all animation, plus [Lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering) (`lenis/react`) for smooth scrolling
- **Fonts (next/font/google):** Anton (display), Inter Tight (hero / header headings), Geist (body), Geist Mono (labels)
- **Package manager:** npm
- **Linting:** ESLint flat config (`eslint-config-next`)
- **Hosting:** Vercel

## Commands

```bash
npm install        # install dependencies
npm run dev        # start dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # production build (also type-checks)
npm run start      # serve the production build
npm run lint       # run ESLint (next build no longer lints)
```

Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before committing.

## Design system

- Background is near-black `ink` (#050505), and text is off-white `paper` (#f4f4ef).
- Accents are `lime` (#d4ff3a, primary), `orange` (#ff5a1f), `pink` (#ff3d9a) and `blue` (#3d7bff). Use them as Tailwind colors (`bg-lime`, `text-orange`, …), never as raw hex values in components.
- `coral` (#ff6f5e) is a light reddish accent used only on the hero (`components/hero.tsx`), to match the reference site's red headline. Don't spread it to other sections — they stay on lime.
- The hero background has an interactive wireframe grid (`components/interactive-grid.tsx`) that ripples away from the pointer and flashes a short word near it on fine-pointer devices. It's a plain `<canvas>` driven by `requestAnimationFrame`, not Motion, so it can redraw every frame without React re-renders. Edit the `WORDS` list there to change the prompts.
- Headlines use `font-display` in uppercase, sized in `vw` so they span the viewport. Labels use `font-mono text-[11px] tracking-widest uppercase`.
- Hero and header headings use `font-heading` (Inter Tight, semibold/bold, tight negative tracking).
- No Japanese or other non-English accent text; the owner asked for it to be removed.
- Use `.text-outline` (or `.text-outline-ink` on light backgrounds) for outlined display text.
- Custom cursor: put `data-cursor="Label"` on any element to show a labelled cursor bubble on hover.

## Code style

- Use TypeScript everywhere and avoid `any`. Prefer `type` over `interface`.
- Function components only. Use PascalCase for component names, kebab-case filenames, and named exports. Default exports only where Next.js requires them (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`).
- Default to Server Components. Add `"use client"` only for components that need state, effects, Motion, or Lenis.
- Keep copy and data in `lib/content.ts`, not hardcoded in components.
- Animate with Motion (`motion.*`, `useScroll`, `useTransform`, `whileInView`). Don't add GSAP or other animation libraries.
- Use the shared easing `[0.76, 0, 0.24, 1]` for big reveals and `[0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]` for softer fades.
- Scroll programmatically with `useLenis()` and `lenis.scrollTo(...)`, not `window.scrollTo`.
- Don't call `setState` synchronously inside `useEffect`, because the lint rule `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` blocks it. Use `useSyncExternalStore` for browser values.
- `whileInView` never fires on an element that is fully clipped by an `overflow-hidden` parent, so observe the parent and drive the child with variants (see `MaskText`).
- Use Tailwind canonical classes (`z-100`, `aspect-4/5`, not `z-[100]`, `aspect-[4/5]`).
- Use `next/image` for every image. Images live in `public/images/`.
- Accessibility: use semantic HTML, `alt` text, `aria-*` on the menu toggle, and keyboard Escape to close the menu.
- Prettier-style formatting: 2-space indent, double quotes, semicolons, trailing commas.

## Git

- Make small, focused commits with imperative messages (e.g. "Add contact form").
- Never commit `.env*` files or secrets.
